# TorrentBot

Discord bot to search and download torrents.

## Some things

1. Don't use for illegal content as that is against Discord's terms of service.
1. Don't even think about making a public bot, that's a bad idea.
1. Only for private and educational use.

## Deployment

Configure users in environment first.  
`yarn deploy <guildId>` to add commands to a guild.  
You need to remove and redeploy to change perms.  
`yarn clear <guildId>` to remove commands.
